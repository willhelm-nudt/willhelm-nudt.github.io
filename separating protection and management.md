# Abstract

Investigates the question of how to offer flexibility and efficiency as well as strong security in cloud infrastructure. This project addresses two important platforms in cloud infrastructures:the containers and the IaaS.Iaas suports secure sharing of cloud resources among mutually untrusted users,but does not provide sufficient flexibility and effiency.Many powerful management primitives enabled by the underlying virtualization platform are hidden from users,such as live virtual machine migration and consolidation.

Library Cloud is a new abstraction that enables more flexible and efficient user-level cloud resource management without breaking security isolation between different users.Together,these systems represent important steps towards secure,flexible,and efficient cloud infrastructure.
